# Compiler
Optimized compiler for a language named YASL (Yet Another Simple Language) in Java. This includes development of lexical analyzer, semantic analyzer (parser), intermediate code generator and a target code generator. The lexical analyzer tokenizes the program; the parser constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) of the program which can be used to generate the intermediate representation (IR) code
